# Cybersecurity  

*A small research into Cyber Security*  

#### The project is structured on three directory:

* [attacks](https://github.com/Dani780-C/Cybersecurity/tree/main/attacks) - contains several attacks I launched on several machines.  
* [captures](https://github.com/Dani780-C/Cybersecurity/tree/main/captures) - contains the traffic captured using Wireshark while attacking.  
* [learn](https://github.com/Dani780-C/Cybersecurity/tree/main/learn) - contains information about services running on the machines.
